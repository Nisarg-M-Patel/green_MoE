# Green MoE

**Stop using GPT-4 to check your grammar.**

Green MoE routes everyday AI tasks to specialized small models (Mixture of Experts approach) running in low carbon intensity regions which is dynamically determined. I use right-sized expert models that consume 90% less energy while delivering comparable results for simple tasks.

## The Problem

Most people use ChatGPT-4 ($20/month) for trivial tasks like:
- Grammar checks → Could use a 100M parameter model
- Email drafts → Could use a 3B parameter model  
- Simple questions → Could use a 7B parameter model

**Result**: Massive energy waste and overpriced convenience.

## Our Solution

1. **Right-sized models**: Grammar Expert (100M), Email Expert (7B), Search Expert (7B)
2. **Green routing**: Real-time routing to renewable energy datacenters
3. **Fair pricing**: $5/month = $5 worth of actual compute

## What We Handle

**Text Tasks Only** - No code generation, no images, no complex agentic workflows.

- **Writing**: Grammar checks, email drafts, tone adjustment
- **Information**: Text summarization, search queries, keyword extraction  
- **Classification**: Sentiment analysis, content categorization
- **Formatting**: Bullet points ↔ paragraphs, length adjustment

## Who This Is For

- **Environmentally conscious**: Care about AI's carbon footprint
- **Cost-conscious**: Don't want to pay $20/month for simple tasks
- **Efficiency-minded**: Hate computational waste

## Pricing

**$5/month gets you:**
- ~5,000 grammar checks
- ~1,000 email drafts  
- ~625 search queries
- Mixed usage: ~1,500-2,000 requests

**No speed upgrades** - everything routes to the lowest carbon intensive available region.

## Environmental Impact

- **tbd% energy reduction** vs large general models
- **tbd%+ renewable energy** from real-time grid optimization
- **Full transparency**: See your CO2 savings and energy sources

## What Makes Us Different

### **Mission-Driven**
I optimize for reducing energy usage, not inference time. No speed tiers, no premium features - just sustainable AI.

### **Specialized Experts**
Instead of one massive model doing everything poorly, I am using task-specific models that excel at their domain.

### **No Compromises**
Every request goes to the least carbon intensive region available. Response times: 3-20 seconds depending on how far the request needs to go.


**Limited Beta** - US-only, gradually onboarding users.
